### 3. **Prepare Your Data**

- Edit the sample CSV file in `assets/samples/file.csv`.
- Each row should contain the participant's details (name, event, date, etc.).

### 4. **Choose a Template**

- Use the UI to:

  1. **Upload your CSV file:**

  - Click the "Upload CSV" or similar button in the web interface.
  - Select your CSV file (e.g., `file.csv` from `assets/samples/`).
  - The app will read the file and display a list of participants.

  2. **Select a template:**

  - Use the template dropdown or selection area to choose your preferred certificate design.
  - You can preview each template instantly as you switch.

  3. **Preview certificates:**

  - After uploading the CSV and selecting a template, the certificate preview will update automatically.
  - You can scroll through each participantâ€™s certificate using navigation buttons or arrows (if available).

  4. **Edit details if needed:**

  - If you spot any errors or want to personalize a certificate, use the provided fields or inline editors to update names, event titles, or other details.
  - Changes will reflect in the preview before exporting.

### 7. **Export as PDF**

## Troubleshooting

- If borders or designs are missing in the PDF, use Chrome for best compatibility.
- Make sure your images are in supported formats (PNG, JPEG).
- For custom templates, use only PDF-friendly CSS (avoid animations, clip-path, etc.).
